# Custom AR Plane Tracking - AR Experience

This project is a custom AR plane tracking experience that allows users to detect horizontal planes, spawn a 3D model, and manipulate it through scaling, rotation, and movement.

## Features:
- Plane detection with a 3D model indicator that includes the student's name (Tito-Paris Olisakwe).
- Object spawning upon detecting and tapping the plane.
- Single object spawn constraint (no multiple objects from repeated taps).
- Color selector to change the color of the spawned object.
- Object transformation: scaling, rotating, and moving the object using either touch (for mobile) or mouse input (for desktop testing).

## AR Plane Type:
The application detects **horizontal planes**. The 3D model is placed and manipulated on a horizontal plane.
